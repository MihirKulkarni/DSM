Distributed Shared Memory Implementation

The assignment is to write your own distributed shared memory
implementation.  The basic idea is that you create (through software)
the illusion that two processes on different machines share the same
address space.  So when a process writes to a memory location in a
page that resides on a remote machine, your implementation should ask
your implementation on the remote machine for a copy, the remote
machine should protect its page, and then the local machine should map
the page's data into its own address space.  If the remote machine
were to access to the page, the same protocol should transfer the page
back.
